# Melooly
## This is a work in progress
Do not use. Not yet ready for production. Things may change at any moment.

Anyways, the `Melooly` class it surfaces can create characters from components, save them, and more.

If you want to use it (why?) you should look at test.ts for an example of how to use the code.
